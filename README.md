## Image similarity tool

Rough initial outline of the plan for the 1st version:
- Use local image files
- Get a large pretrained image model
- Feed forward all images thru the model and extract the features as vectors
- Use eucl. distance / cosine similarity etc. to compare pairs of images
- Get the closest one, or top-k
